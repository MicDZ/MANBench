It can retain heat well but can also lose it quickly if exposed to cold air.\n     - The blue color might indicate a double-walled design, which can enhance heat retention by trapping heat inside.\n   - **Metal Kettle**:\n     - Metal is an excellent conductor of heat. It can retain heat for a longer period compared to glass.\n     - The stainless steel material is known for its excellent heat retention properties.\n\n3. **Design**:\n   - The first kettle has a double-walled design, which is evident from the blue color indicating insulation.\n   - The second kettle has a single-walled design, which means it relies solely on the metal's inherent heat retention properties.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nGiven the materials and design, the second kettle, made of stainless steel, is likely to have a better heat retention effect. The metal's excellent conductivity and the absence of a double-walled design suggest it can retain heat more effectively than the glass kettle, which, while it can retain heat, might lose it more quickly due to its poorer thermal conductivity.",

Let's re-evaluate the structure:\n\n- The larger cube has 3 layers.\n- Each layer has 3 cubes in width and 3 cubes in depth.\n\nSo, the total number of smaller cubes is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27 \\]\n\nBut we need to subtract the cubes that are not part of the larger cube.

This means that the smaller cube shares one vertex with the larger cube and has edges that extend into the larger cube.\n\n3. **Count the Smaller Cubes:**\n   - The smaller cube has 6 faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices.\n   - Since the smaller cube is removed from one corner, it does not contribute any additional faces, edges, or vertices to the larger cube.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Number of Small Cubes:**\n   - The larger cube has 6 faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices.\n   - The smaller cube has 6 faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices.\n   - The total number of small cubes is the sum of the faces, edges, and vertices of both cubes.\n\n   - **Faces:** 6 (larger cube) + 6 (smaller cube) = 12\n   - **Edges:** 12 (larger cube) + 12 (smaller cube) = 24\n   - **Vertices:** 8 (larger cube) + 8 (smaller cube) = 16\n\n   However, since the smaller cube is removed from one corner, we need to subtract the 6 faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices of the smaller cube that are not part of the larger cube.\n\n   - **Faces:** 12 - 6 = 6\n   - **Edges:** 24 - 12 = 12\n   - **Vertices:** 16 - 8 = 8\n\n   Therefore, the total number of small cubes is 6 (faces) + 12 (edges) + 8 (vertices) = 26.\n\nHowever, this calculation seems incorrect because it counts the same faces, edges, and vertices multiple times.

Let's analyze the pattern step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern in the First Image:**\n   - The first image shows a 3x3 grid with the following symbols:\n     - Top row: \u00d7, \u2227, \u2228\n     - Middle row: +, \u25ef, \u25cb\n     - Bottom row: ||, \u2295,?\n\n2. **Analyze the Pattern:**\n   - The first column shows a progression from a cross (\u00d7) to a plus sign (+) to two vertical lines (||).\n   - The second column shows a progression from a triangle (\u2227) to a circle (\u25ef) to a circle with a cross in the middle (\u2295).\n   - The third column shows a progression from a triangle (\u2228) to a circle (\u25cb) to a question mark (?).\n\n3. **Determine the Next Symbol:**\n   - The pattern in the third column suggests that the next symbol should be a symbol that follows the same progression as the previous two columns.\n   - The progression in the third column is: \u2228 \u2192 \u25cb \u2192?\n   - The progression in the second column is: \u2227 \u2192 \u25ef \u2192 \u2295\n\n4. **Identify the Correct Option:**\n   - The correct symbol should follow the same pattern as the third column, which is a progression from a triangle to a circle to a symbol that follows the same pattern.\n\nGiven the options:\n(A) Picture A\n(B) Picture B\n(C) Picture C\n(D) Picture D\n\nThe correct answer is (C) Picture C, as it follows the same pattern of progression from a triangle to a circle to a symbol that follows the same pattern.",
