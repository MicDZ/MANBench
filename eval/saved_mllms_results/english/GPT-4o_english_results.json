We need to look for continuity in the lines at the bottom and right edges of the missing spot.\n\n2. **Key patterns to focus on at the lower-right edges:**\n   - A **green line** extending diagonally downward from the left to the edge.\n   - A **purple line** extending diagonally downward starting from near the top-right edge, moving downward into the missing corner.\n   - A **blue line** starting from higher up along the right edge, extending downward toward where the missing section would be.\n\n### Step-by-step comparison:\n\n1. **Option (A): The second image**\n   - The purple line in this piece matches well with the purple line extending from the top of the main image.\n   - The orange line also matches with the orange line traveling diagonally, creating continuity.\n   - The positioning of other lines (e.g., green and blue) also fits perfectly with the surrounding edges of the original image.\n   - This could very likely be the missing piece.\n\n2. **Option (B): The third image**\n   - The lines do not align with the main image.

Each square contains symbols that follow a certain pattern. Let\u2019s analyze each position and determine the rule:\n\n#### First Row:\n1. The first square contains two symbols (a circle and a triangle) inside a box split diagonally. The circle is in the top-left corner, and the triangle is in the bottom-right corner.\n2. The second square contains two symbols (a square and a \"T\") inside a box split in the same diagonal way. The square is in the top-left corner, and the \"T\" is in the bottom-right corner.\n\n#### Second Row:\n1. The first square in the second row contains a circle in the top-left corner and a \"T\" in the bottom-right corner.\n2. The missing square in the second row (represented by \"?\") should complete the pattern.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Rule\nThe rule seems to involve a combination of the shapes from the squares in the first row:\n- In the first row, the first square's top-left symbol (a circle) is paired with the bottom-right symbol from the second square (the \"T\"). This yields the first square in the second row.\n- For the missing square: It will be created by combining the **top-left symbol** from the first square in the first row (**triangle**) with the **bottom-right symbol** from the second square in the first row (**square**).\n\nThus, the missing square should have a **triangle in the top-left corner** and a **square in the bottom-right corner.**\n\n### Step 3: Match with the Options\nNow, look at the four options (A, B, C, D):\n- (A): A triangle in the top-left and square in the bottom-right. **This is correct.**\n- (B): Does not match.\n- (C): Does not match.\n- (D): Does not match.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct choice is **(A) Picture A.**",

It does not build on the diamond shape from the previous step. **Eliminate.**\n\n- **(B) Picture B (\u00d7)**: The multiplication symbol `\u00d7` introduces an additional intersection within the prior diamond shape. This could suggest a possible development from the prior step, but it completely changes the existing design language. **Unlikely.**\n\n- **(C) Picture C (%)**: The percentage symbol `%` introduces a curve element (not present in the prior sequences, which focused on line-based geometric shapes). This does not follow the logical evolution. **Eliminate.**\n\n- **(D) Picture D (\u222b)**: The integral symbol `\u222b` introduces a new type of structure \u2014 continuous curved lines \u2014 which doesn't align with the prior progression of increasing complexity in geometric shapes. **Eliminate.**\n\n### Conclusion: \nBased on the given options and the established pattern, **none of the options (A, B, C, D)** seem to perfectly align with the progression observed in the sample sequence.

To solve it, visualize how the net would fold into a 3D cube and check which option matches the arrangement and alignment of the triangular faces.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n1. Look at the unfolded net:\n   - There are 6 square faces with triangular patterns that need to be folded into a cube.\n   - Observe how each square connects to its neighbors (adjacent edges will dictate which faces meet when folded).\n\n2. Begin folding the net in your mind:\n   - The middle square in the second row will serve as the cube's bottom face.\n   - The four squares connected to the middle one (top, bottom, left, and right) will fold up to form the sides of the cube.\n   - The far-right square will fold over to form the top face of the cube.\n\n3. Compare possibilities:\n   - As the cube folds, pay attention to the relative positions of the triangular lines. The alignment needs to match one of the folded configurations in the options.\n\n4. Process of elimination:\n   - Option A: The alignments do not match. Eliminate.\n   - Option B: The alignments do not match. Eliminate.\n   - Option C: The alignments match!

The striped triangle and the large black circle cannot be adjacent, as shown in Option B. In the unfolded net, these faces are separated by three folds, so this arrangement is impossible.\n\n#### **Option C**:\nThis is incorrect. The small black square and the plain white face cannot be adjacent because they are on opposite ends of the net.\n\n#### **Option D**:\nThis is correct.

This means Individual 9 can only inherit either the dominant (A) or recessive (a) allele from the affected parent and must inherit a recessive (a) allele from the unaffected parent.\n\n   - As Individual 9 is unaffected, they cannot possess the dominant disease-associated allele (A). Therefore, their genotype must be **aa**.\n\n---\n\n### Correct Answer:\n**(C) Aa or AA**\n\nIt dear likely",

Since the chain is symmetric and infinite, the effective resistance between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) remains constant regardless of how far down the chain we look. Let\u2019s denote the effective resistance between terminals \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) as \\( R_{eq} \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Setting Up the Recursive Equation\n\nThe key property of an infinite network is that removing a single \"section\" (the first resistor block) leaves another infinite set of resistors, which has the same equivalent resistance, \\( R_{eq} \\).\n\nFor the given configuration:\n1. Start at terminal \\( a \\).\n2. Between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n   - There is a resistor \\( R = 1 \\) in series with a parallel combination of:\n     - One resistor \\( R = 1 \\).\n     - Another identical infinite chain with equivalent resistance \\( R_{eq} \\).\n\nThe equivalent resistance can be expressed as:\n\\[\nR_{eq} = R + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R_{eq}}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( R = 1 \\):\n\\[\nR_{eq} = 1 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{R_{eq}}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplify the parallel resistance term:\n\\[\nR_{eq} = 1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{R_{eq}}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( R_{eq} \\)\n\nLet\u2019s solve the recursive equation:\n\\[\nR_{eq} = 1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{R_{eq}}}\n\\]\n\nReorganize terms for simplicity:\n\\[\nR_{eq} = 1 + \\frac{R_{eq}}{R_{eq} + 1}\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by \\( R_{eq} + 1 \\) to eliminate the fraction:\n\\[\nR_{eq}(R_{eq} + 1) = (R_{eq} + 1) + R_{eq}\n\\]\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\\[\nR_{eq}^2 + R_{eq} = R_{eq} + 1 + R_{eq}\n\\]\n\\[\nR_{eq}^2 = 1\n\\]\n\nTaking the positive root:\n\\[\nR_{eq} = \\sqrt{1} = 0.73 \\, \\text{(approximately)}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:  \nThe equivalent resistance between terminals \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is approximately **0.73** ohms.  \n\nCorrect option: **D**",

The relationship between the speed of light (\\(v\\)) in a medium and its refractive index (\\(n\\)) is:\n  \\[\n  v = \\frac{c}{n}\n  \\]\n  where \\(c\\) is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n- **Snell's Law:** Describes the relationship between angles of incidence (\\(\\theta_1\\)) and refraction (\\(\\theta_2\\)) at the boundary:\n  \\[\n  n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2)\n  \\]\n\nNow, look at the diagram:\n\n1. **Medium 1 to Medium 2:** The beam bends **toward the normal**. This indicates that the light is entering a medium with a **higher refractive index** (\\(n_2 > n_1\\)) and thus a **lower speed of light** (\\(v_2 < v_1\\)).\n\n2. **Medium 2 to Medium 3:** The beam bends **away from the normal**. This indicates that the light is entering a medium with a **lower refractive index** (\\(n_3 < n_2\\)) and thus a **higher speed of light** (\\(v_3 > v_2\\)).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe speed of light decreases in Medium 2 compared to Medium 1, and then increases in Medium 3 compared to Medium 2.

Is bonded to **four different groups**.\n\n### Step-by-Step Inspection:\n\n1. **Examine the structure of each carbon atom:**\n   - Look for sp\u00b3 hybridized carbons (single bonds only).\n   - For each such carbon, analyze whether it is connected to four different groups substituents.\n\n   From the structure provided, the molecule contains multiple sp\u00b3 carbon atoms. Let's analyze them one-by-one.\n\n---\n\n2. **Identify the chiral centers:**\n\n   - **Carbon 1 (attached to the nitrogen atom):** \n     This carbon has four unique substituents:\n       - A methyl group (-CH\u2083).\n       - A nitrogen atom.\n       - A hydrogen atom.\n       - The rest of the bicyclic structure.\n     \u2192 **Chiral center.**\n\n   - **Carbon 2 (next in the bicyclic ring):**\n     This carbon is sp\u00b3, bonded to:\n       - A single hydrogen atom.\n       - The oxygen atom (part of the ether group).\n       - The rest of the bicyclic system on one side.\n       - The remaining part of the molecule on the other side.\n     \u2192 **Chiral center.**\n\n   - **Remaining stereocenters in the molecule:**\n     Similar analysis shows **three additional carbons** (on the rings) as chiral centers. Each of these has four distinct groups around them, making them stereogenic centers.\n\n---\n\n3. **Final Count:**\n   There are **5 chirality centers** in the given molecule.\n\n---\n\n### Correct Answer:\n**(A) 5**",
