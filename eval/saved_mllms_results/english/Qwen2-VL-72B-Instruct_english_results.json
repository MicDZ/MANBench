It allows heat to escape quickly.\n\n2. **Second Kettle (Option B)**:\n   - This kettle appears to be made of metal, likely stainless steel.\n   - Metal, especially stainless steel, is a good conductor of heat but also retains heat better than glass.

This indicates that medium 2 has a higher refractive index than medium 1.\n   - The speed of light is inversely proportional to the refractive index. Therefore, the speed of light in medium 2 (v_2) is less than the speed of light in medium 1 (v_1).\n\n2. **Medium 2 to Medium 3:**\n   - The light beam bends away from the normal as it moves from medium 2 to medium 3.
