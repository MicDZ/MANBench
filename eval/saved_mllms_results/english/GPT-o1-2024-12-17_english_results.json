Counting these gives\n\n• Front face: x = 1 or 2, y = 1, z = 1,2,3 → 6 cubes  \n• Right face: x = 2, y = 1 or 2, z = 1,2,3 → 6 cubes  \n\nBut three of those cubes (x=2, y=1, z=1,2,3) are counted in both sets, so the union is 6 + 6 − 3 = 9 distinct cubes.  \n\nAll of those cubes can be supported from below (no “floating” cubes) and reproduce exactly the visible faces in the picture.

Under complete penetrance, this rules out an autosomal‐dominant trait (because one parent would have to be affected if three offspring inherited a dominant allele). It also makes X‐linked explanations untenable (for instance, X‐linked‐dominant inheritance would force all daughters of an affected father to be affected).\n\nThat leaves autosomal‐recessive inheritance, in which affected individuals are “aa.” Hence Individuals 3, 6, and 7 are aa. Since Individual 3 (aa) marries an unaffected partner (Individual 4), who must carry at least one normal (“A”) allele, their children can only be “aa” (affected) or “Aa” (unaffected carrier). Individual 9 is unaffected, so the only possibility is “Aa.” \n\nThus, the correct choice is:\n\n(B) Aa.",
