## Introduction

We introduce **MANBench** (Multimodal Ability Norms Benchmark), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the multimodal capabilities of both humans and MLLMs. MANBench consists of 9
tasks, each containing more than 110 questions, with a total of 1,314 questions and 2,231 images. MANBench aims to provide a fair and rigorous assessment framework, ensuring that comparisons between human and machine performance are conducted on an equitable basis.

We conducted a large-scale human evaluation using the MANBench dataset, systematically comparing the performance of humans and MLLMs across a range of multimodal tasks. We evaluated 11 MLLMs, including state-of-art GPT-4o, Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct, and Gemini-1.5 Pro on MANBench. We recruited 575 participants from diverse backgrounds to complete the tasks. Our results reveal that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding, they struggle in tasks requiring deeper cross-modal reasoning, such as Transmorphic Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Notably, both humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and Spatial Imagination.

## Load Dataset

```python
import datasets

dataset_name = 'MANBench/MANBench'
dataset = load_dataset(dataset_name, split='train')
```

## Evaluation

1. Set up the environment variables.
```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
```
2. Run the following command to evaluate the model on the MANBench dataset.
```sh
python eval/test_benchmark.py
```

*If ImportError occurs while executing this case, please install the required dependency packages as prompted.*

Feel free to add more models to `eval/query_model.py` and evaluate them on the MANBench dataset.

## Disclaimers

**Low population coverage:** The experimental subjects in our study were primarily focused on a specific group within the Chinese linguistic context, which may introduce limitations in cross-linguistic adaptability. Specifically, cultural disparities, variations in knowledge reserves, and differences in cognitive patterns could significantly influence the applicability of our findings. Furthermore, the educational backgrounds and age distributions of our participants do not fully represent the broader human population, potentially limiting the generalizability of the human benchmarks established in this study.
